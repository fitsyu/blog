Let's count our failures up to before this blog.
There were:

- Wordpress
- Blogspot
- Tumblr
- Blogspot (Again)
- Jekyll

\* Now we are going to use `Hexo!`

We choose `Cactus\light`theme.

It looks simple but very nice.

We hope we feel at home with them.

Now, to help us starting-over writing again if anytime in the future somehow we've stopped bloggin for whatever reason.

Follow these easy steps below!

1. Get things ready
2. Write a post
3. Publish

## 1. Get Things Ready
we need locally:

- node
- npm
- hexo-cli
- markdown editor 

after having those tools,

clone the blog from its repository.

here is the repository address:
> https://github.com/fitsyu/blog.git


there are two branches:

1. branch `write` 

	This is similar to `develop` branch in a development project. Here we do all the work of writing and the blog internal system configuration
	
2. branch `master`

	This is the deploy target branch where command `hexo deploy` will generate static assets for public to consume.
	

## 2. Writing a Post
first, get into blog directory.

then execute `hexo new post <PostTitle>`

it should generate empty post file in source/_post

then edit the file to start writing by a command like this 

`macdown source/_post/PostTitle.md`


## 3. Publish
after writing a post if we want it seen by public

we can publish it this way

`hexo deploy`

open the site in a browser

hopefully it has sit there nicely along others previous posts.

Thats it!.

We hope we write more as we develop, work, learn more.

To have nice contents is great.

But it would be even greate if we release it to world.

> Go write!
